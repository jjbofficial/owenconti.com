Before we begin, please review and confirm you agree with the following points. If you don't agree with these points, this article may not be for you.

* DX to find a piece of code is top priority
* * Devs should never have to use global search to find code
* * Devs should never have to use the file explorer to find code
* * Any dev you ask on your team should give you the same answer when asked which file X piece of code is in
* * These points will mean devs will not get frustrated while looking for something in the code base
* Smaller files are easier to read, parse, understand, and edit. There's less to manage in your head when files are smaller.
* Patterns should be defined, documented, and enforced
* * The entire premise of this article only works if the patterns you define for your team are followed. This article will show you a very simple pattern that is hard to get wrong.

## CRUD Review

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. It was coined by X in 1983. Think back to 1983, what types of applications were being built back then? I would argue that applications we build today look and function nothing like the ones built in 1983. Sure, there's some similarities, but most of the applications being built today are much more advanced than they were back then.
